## What is HIRELY?

HIRELY is a full-stack HR Management System built to modernize how teams handle recruitment, employee records, and HR workflows.

> Most HR tools are bloated and expensive. HIRELY keeps it focused — track applicants, manage employees, handle leave requests, and get a clear view of your workforce from one clean dashboard. No fluff, just what HR actually needs.

This started as a school project under a tight two-month sprint. It turned into something I genuinely care about — a system I designed from wireframe to final build, while also leading the team as Scrum Master.

---

## What I Built

> A full-stack Laravel application with role-based access, a recruitment pipeline, an employee directory, and an HR dashboard — built Agile, shipped on time.

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;<b>Recruitment pipeline</b></summary>
<br/>
End-to-end applicant tracking from application to onboarding. HR can update applicant status, add notes, and move candidates through stages — all from a single view. No spreadsheets, no email chains.
</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;<b>Employee directory</b></summary>
<br/>
A searchable, filterable list of all employees with profile pages showing role, department, contact info, and documents. Admins can add, edit, or archive records. Built to handle real organizational data cleanly.
</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;<b>Role-based access control</b></summary>
<br/>
Three permission levels — Admin, HR Officer, and Employee — each with a scoped view of the system. Employees see their own profile and leave history. HR sees recruitment and records. Admins see everything.
</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;<b>Leave management</b></summary>
<br/>
Employees submit leave requests directly through the system. HR reviews and approves or rejects with one click. Leave balances update automatically and are visible on the employee's profile.
</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;<b>Dashboard analytics</b></summary>
<br/>
A real-time overview of headcount, open positions, pending leave requests, and recent activity — giving HR a pulse on the organization without digging through tables.
</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;<b>UI/UX design</b></summary>
<br/>
Every screen was wireframed and prototyped in Figma before a single line of code was written. The interface is clean, accessible, and designed around how HR actually works — not how developers imagine it does.
</details>

## My Role

I served as both **Scrum Master** and **UI/UX Designer** — two roles that ended up being more connected than I expected.

**As Scrum Master:**
- Ran daily standups, sprint planning sessions, and retrospectives
- Tracked milestones and surfaced blockers before they became problems
- Maintained 100% accuracy across technical documentation and data workflows
- Enforced strict data confidentiality protocols following agreed SOPs

**As UI/UX Designer:**
- Led the full design process — from lo-fi sketches to Figma prototypes
- Designed interfaces around real HR tasks, not assumed ones
- Ran usability checks with the team and iterated before handoff
- Ensured every screen passed accessibility and consistency checks

## Run It Locally

> Clone, install, configure, and you're running in minutes.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dvphnc/hirely.git
cd hirely
composer install
npm install
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
```

Configure your database in `.env`, then:

```bash
php artisan migrate --seed
npm run dev
```

Open a second terminal:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

Open `http://localhost:8000` — you're in.
